The portal aims to connect Recruiter, CIC, and Student so that the IP and Placement process could be conducted easily at [NIIT University](https://niituniversity.in/). The project was made under the guidance of [Geetica Rastogi](https://github.com/SiddheshShinde-tech/NU-Placement-Portal) <strong>(CIC Head)</strong> and [Mr.Bipin Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bipin-kumar-ab10234/)<strong>(CIC Team)</strong> and also aims to integrate <strong>NUcleus ERP</strong> with the portal.
